# Dispricery

Dispricery, a website to help users find the best prices and deals that dispensaries are advertising in the local area. 

## Getting Started

In order to begin, first create an account or log in. Then you are able to view two stores at once allowing you to quickly compare them. If you like a store you can add it to your favorites, if you don't like one you can always swap it out.
